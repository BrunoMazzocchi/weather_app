# Weather App

Weather app built with Flutter


This project is a side project to know what I'm able to code right now as my first personal project. 

To build the application I used bloc pattern and a generic bloc provider (weather bloc provider)
I'm using three API
Open weather API to get the current weather and 5 day forecast 
Country API to get a list of countries and their cities


For the same reason, some cities and countries might not work properly, as the Open Weather API won't recognize them
